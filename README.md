# tng-sp-ia

In the TANGO Service Platform the Infrastructure Abstraction plays the role of an abstraction layer between the MANO framework and the underlying (virtualised) infrastructure.
The Infrastructure Abstraction allows the orchestrator's entities to interact with the infrastructure, regardless of the specific technology used to manage it. It exposes interfaces to manage service and VNF instances, retrieve monitoring information about the infrastructure status, reserve resources for services deployment.
It is composed of two main modules, the Infrastructure Abstractor - NorthBound Interface and the VIM/WAN wrappers.
